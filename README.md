# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Concept
**CHIP-8** is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker and initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine.

This project consists of an emulator for the original CHIP-8 interpreted language. It implements some of the fundamental concepts of Computer Architecture, such as dealing with the CPU structure, instruction cycle, I/O and system frequency.

## Prerequisites

## Step by step

## Installation

## Usage

## To-Do List
- Test compatibility with Windows systems;
- Substitute SDL2 for `egui`;
- Create a proper debugger with:
	- A disassembler;
	- An option to pause/resume the emulator;
	- An option to choose new ROM files;
	- An option to reload the same game;
	- An option to change background and sprite colors.
